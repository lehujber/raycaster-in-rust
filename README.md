Raycast renderer written in rust using sdl2.
There is still much to be improved on it, for example:
- Optimization
- Gamestate (especially map) code is reseblent of spaghetti
- Fisheye effect in rendering

The point of this project was for me to see if I could write something like this by figuring out the math instead of just looking it up.

This was also my first real attempt at learning rust, so there may be parts of it that aren't idiomatic.
